Prove that $y_1=cost$ and $y_2=sint$ are a fundamental set of solutions of $y" + y = 0$ and that the Wronskian isn't zero. 
\begin{definition}[characteristic equation]
The characteristic equation of a $2^{nd}$ order differential equation is \newline
$ay" + by' + cy = 0$
\end{definition}

\begin{equation} \label{eqref:1}
y" + y = 0 
\end{equation}
is a characteristic equation where a = 1, b = 0, c = 1.

\begin{theorem}
Suppose the characteristic equation:
$ay" + by' + cy = 0$

Then, $y = e^{rt}$ where r is defined as

$ar^2 + br + c = 0$
\end{theorem}

Solving for r and finding the solutions for equation $\eqref{eqref:1}$
\begin{center}
$y" + y = 0$

$r^2 + r = 0$

$r^2 = -1$

$r_1 = i, r_2 = -i$

$y_1 = ce^{it}$ and $y_2 = ce^{-it}$
\end{center}

\begin{theorem} [Euler's Formula]
$e^{it} = cost + isint$
\end{theorem}

$y_1 = c_1cost + c_2isint$ and $y_2 = c_3cos(-t) + c_4sin(-t)$

\begin{theorem} [Trigonometric Formulas]
$sin(-t) = -sin(t)$

$cos(-t) = cos(t)$

\end{theorem} 
\begin{definition}[General Solution of a Homogeneous Differential Equation]
The general solution of a homgeneous differential equation is the sum of its solutions. So if $y_1$ and $y_2$ is a solution, the general solution, $y$, is $y = y_1 + y_2$
\end{definition}
$y = c_1cost + c_2sint$

$c_3$ and $c_4$ is absorbed by $c_1$ and $c_2$
